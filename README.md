# Touch-Piano-screen-based-on-capacitance-transducers

Key aspects:

• Developed a touch piano using seven capacitive sensors as input keys, programmed with Arduino to detect capacitance changes and output corresponding audio via a passive buzzer.

• Designed the custom PCB layout for the sensor array and circuitry using Eagle PCB, ensuring reliable sensor integration and compact hardware design.
